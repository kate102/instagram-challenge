## Class Responsibility Collaborator Diagram
In this repository with this README is the CRC diagram. 
This shows the 2 classes, users and posts but I have extended it to provide information on the possible database tables.

##Â Background
Now that I have an idea of what I am going to write I now need to work out how.
I am going to use Ruby on Rails for the framework (Ruby as the programming language, clearly).
To install rails I use the following command `rails new grimstagram`
This provides me with the rails framework. 
I am using rails version 5.1.7 for this project.
